# notes

these are possibly useful tricks when using openscad :)
but...because sometimes I forget things like this...its good to have these noted somewhere...

## PDF conversion

* use openscad-nightly ; other version may export an svg without mm unit
* openscad / export svg
* inkscape --without-gui --export-pdf=foo.pdf esp-gen-1-b.svg
* acroread foo.pdf
